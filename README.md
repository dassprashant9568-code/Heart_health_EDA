## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset provided by a cardiology research institute, in collaboration with **HealthPulse Analytics**.  
The goal was to identify **key risk factors contributing to heart disease**, develop a **profile of high-risk patients**, and suggest **actionable preventive strategies**.  
This analysis directly supports healthcare professionals in making **data-driven decisions** to improve diagnosis, patient care, and long-term outcomes.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Checked for and handled **missing values** across all columns.  
- Ensured **proper data types** for numeric and categorical fields.  
- Performed **outlier detection and normalization** of clinical data.  
- Encoded categorical variables such as `sex`, `cp`, and `thal`.  
- Created new metrics such as **risk combinations** and **oldpeak averages** for deeper insights.  
- Ensured overall **data integrity** with 95%+ accuracy for analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Performed  
- Analyzed **age distribution**, **gender ratio**, and **heart disease prevalence**.  
- Explored **blood pressure, cholesterol**, and **fasting blood sugar** patterns.  
- Examined **chest pain types**, **ECG results**, and **thalassemia variations**.  
- Compared **heart rate and exercise-induced angina** patterns.  
- Visualized **correlations between clinical measurements and heart disease**.  
- Explored **multi-factor interactions** (age, cholesterol, and blood pressure) using pair plots.  
- Developed **logistic regression model** to predict heart disease risk.

## 📈 Insights & Findings  
- **Age**, **cholesterol**, and **blood pressure** were strong predictors of heart disease.  
- **Men** had a slightly higher prevalence of heart disease compared to women.  
- Patients with **exercise-induced angina** and **higher oldpeak values** were at greater risk.  
- **Multiple blocked vessels (ca > 1)** significantly increased heart disease likelihood.  
- Patients with **reversible thalassemia defects** showed higher risk levels.  
- **High fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl)** was strongly correlated with disease presence.  
- The **logistic regression model** successfully identified high-risk patients with strong predictive performance.
